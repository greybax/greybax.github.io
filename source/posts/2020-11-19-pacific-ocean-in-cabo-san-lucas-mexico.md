The sister hotel was on the other side of Cabo - overlooking the ocean. The hotel is very large, stands on a cliff, so you can walk there, but either not far, or not in the heat. The highest point is the Sky Pool, with an “infinite” pool for sunset, setting next to a cape called “False”. On the same cape there are 2 lighthouses - an old one next to the water, and a new one at the very top.

The ocean sparkles with incredible emerald colors, but you can’t swim in it. More precisely, you can, but only once - the last time. On the beach, they watch so that no one goes into the water. But on the lower level, very close to the beach, there is also a large pool. It was there that I stopped being afraid to open my eyes underwater, and then I swam only like that, and even in the sea (although the water there, of course, is murkier). And how can you not swim - all the guests (mostly Americans) sit at the sides and drink cocktails one after another. The middle is empty - swim as much as you want.

On one side of the pool is a small rock, as we were told - the southernmost point of the California Peninsula. On the other side are villas, including Tinkov's La Dacha (only 1 of 5). If we had known about this then - we would have definitely gone closer along the beach! Watching the waves, we once saw a pelican, which almost cut the waves with its wing, hoping to catch a fish jumping out of the water. Here we did not see them, but from the sea side, especially at dawn and sunset - schools of fish were visible, which either swam on the very surface, or even jumped out of the water, as if someone was chasing them.

In the evening we returned to the upper pool to watch the sunset. We were lucky - it was closed, but they let us watch, and we stayed to wait. Several more people came after us, but they left before the sun touched the ocean - strange. There were many boats visible on the water - apparently many people come to watch the sunset from the water. And also - as the sun went down, everyone sailed back. And all the beauty began only after - the sky lit up with bright red-orange colors. And not a single cloud. It never rains in Southern California!
