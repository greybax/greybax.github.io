As I already mentioned in my previous post [Netherlands life. The Dutch cuisine](/posts/netherlands-life-the-dutch-cuisine/) Netherlads has the awesome authentic local cuisine. We've enjoyied and discovered new dishes while staying in NL.

But its not a secret that Netherlands pretty famous with their local beer and breweries. Everybody knows their famous [Heineken beer brand](https://www.heineken.com/). The HQ is in the center of Amsterdam.

During our staying in NL I've created my collection of Amsterdam Breweries on Yelp. Check it out!

<div id="collection-container-ef62d740" style="height: 700px; overflow-y: auto;"></div><script src="https://www.yelp.com/collection/pw1rMyB0lvaOTm-yV2hOLQ/embed?container=collection-container-ef62d740&sort_by=date&limit=20"></script>

Feel free to create your own breweries collection based on mine. Or just let me know if I miss ones to add (since I no longer live in NL its hard to maintain it and keep up-to-date)

Happy NL Beer tasting! :y:
