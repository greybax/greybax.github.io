Usually we spend a bunch of time while reading and surfing others open source project on GitHub. It turned out, this process can be much better. Here is a short list of most useful extensions which I'm using right now and could be interesting for you too.

## Octotree

> Browser extension (Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari) to show a code tree on GitHub. Awesome for exploring project source without having to pull every single repository to your machine.

**Features:**
  - Easy-to-navigate code tree, just like in IDEs
  - Fast browsing with pjax
  - Support private repositories (see instructions)
  - Support GitHub Enterprise (Chrome and Opera only, see instructions)

## OctoLinker

> OctoLinker is a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox and Opera which allows you to navigate through code on GitHub more efficiently. It turns language-specific module-loading statements like include, require or import into links. Depending on the language it will either redirect you to the referenced file or to an external website like a manual page or another service.
