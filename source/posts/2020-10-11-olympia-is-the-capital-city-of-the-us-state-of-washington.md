We've lived in the state for so long - and we haven't been to the capital! After all, the capital is not Seattle, but Olympia. It's an hour's drive away (an hour and a half if you're stuck in traffic).

The city is a little over 150 years old, but only about 50 thousand people live there. As befits a capital, the Capitol is located here, which is visible from the highway. Up close, it looks even more majestic, although now, of course, it is closed, but you can sit on the steps and they are all yours! There are many administrative buildings nearby in the same style - with columns.

The Capitol is on a hill, so you can see the lower part of the city from the embankment. Although this is the capital, there are no high-rises here, all the houses are mostly one- and two-story. There are also green lawns near the Capitol, and signs that, for example, the fruit of the state is an apple, and the state bird is a goldfinch. Nearby there are monuments in memory of the First World War.

We walked to the lower part of the city (although on the map it is on top), and there is a pretty nice embankment, with a view of the Capitol again. On the opposite side, the Olympic Mountains were peeking out.

On the way back to the car (which we parked in the courtyards near the Capitol - parking is closed after all) we found some interesting castle, which turned out to be the old Capitol.

Among the famous residents of this city is Kurt Cobain, who lived here for 2 years and wrote most of his most famous songs, which made up the album Nevermind.
