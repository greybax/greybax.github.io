Marken (**30min by bus from Amsterdam**) - is a traditional Dutch village where you can learn Zen by watching swans, cows, horses, sheep, goats and other animals (the main thing is not to get blown away).

I saw a seashell beach here for the first time - it's so unusual when small seashells crunch under my feet ...

Only half a century ago, the island was connected by a dam with the mainland. The entire island (area 2.7 sq km) is home to about two thousand people. In the summer, a boat runs to Volendam.
