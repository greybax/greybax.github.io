Munich is famous for its Oktoberfest. In August, Teresa's meadow (a gigantic beer festival field) is almost ready to welcome guests. The last flaws are being polished and everything is still covered with a net.

In the center, there is still a little bit of history left, although goose bumps run from the old photo of the women's cathedral right after the war. And it was restored, as if nothing had happened.

Another must-have is the HofBrauHaus, which can accommodate 4,000 people. Liter mugs, giant pretzels and sausages. In the last century, Lenin and Hitler, who created a nationalist party in the largest hall, fermented here.

And of course, where without an apple strudel :) although there are many different types of them.
