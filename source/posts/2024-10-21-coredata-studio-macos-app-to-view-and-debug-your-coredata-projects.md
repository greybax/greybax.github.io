## Intro

Hey there, fellow iOS App Devs! Recently, I've shared with some of my iOS development experience in these posts:

* [How to handle different versions of Core Data Models](/posts/how-to-handle-different-versions-of-core-data-models/)
* [AppScreen Studio - macOS App to Create Screenshots and Previews for Your AppStore Apps](appscreen-studio-macos-app-to-create-screenshots-and-previews-for-your-appstore-apps)

So here is my another tool which will simplify iOS development.

## The Story Behind CoreData Studio

As an iOS developer, I've struggled with debugging CoreData projects. I've spent hours trying to figure out why my data wasn't being saved or why my app was crashing. That's why I created CoreData Studio - to make debugging CoreData projects easier and faster.
