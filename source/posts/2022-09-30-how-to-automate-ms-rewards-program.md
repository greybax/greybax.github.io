## Intro

I already have written about [MS Rewards Program](/posts/getting-cool-free-swags-via-microsoft-rewards-program/) a quite ago. 
In this post I'd like to write about how you can automate process of getting points.
Pretty obvious solution is:
1. Login into your account via MS Edge browser
2. open via iframe `https://www.bing.com/search?q=${YOUR_SEARCH_STRING_HERE}`
3. repeat it
    * 150 / 5 = 30 for browser search
    * 20 / 5 = 4 for Edge browser specific search
    * 100 / 5 = 20 for mobile search

_**Please note**_: these numbers only for US region.

## MSEdgeSearchClicker

So that's how my project [MSEdgeSearchClicker](https://github.com/greybax/MSEdgeSearchClicker) was born on Github.

For now it supports only points automation for search only. But feel free to send [fork and send your PRs](https://github.com/greybax/MSEdgeSearchClicker/fork) or suggest improvements via [issues page](https://github.com/greybax/MSEdgeSearchClicker/issues) 

Happy your routine automation! :y:
