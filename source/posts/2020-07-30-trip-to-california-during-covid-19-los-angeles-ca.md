Downtown Los Angeles, 20 minutes by car from Santa Monica and the airport, was our destination on the fourth day before our departure. Before leaving, we took one last look at the cloudy ocean, then headed to USC (University of Southern California). It's not as famous as other universities, but Phoebe from Charmed studied there and it was in one of the buildings (where we sat on a bench) that she met Cole. Nearby is a park with a passenger airplane, a Lockheed A-12 spy plane, the Endeavour space shuttle, and other aircraft in the aerospace exhibition center. Next to it is the Coliseum, a sports complex that is the only one in the world to have hosted two Olympics (in 1932 and 1984), two Super Bowls (the first and seventh), and the speeches of three presidents (Kennedy, Nixon, and Reagan). But two Olympics are not enough, as there will be a third in 2028!

Our next stop was St. Vincent and Paul's Church, an incredibly beautiful building from 1925 that appeared in Charmed, the movie Constantine, and Madonna's music videos.

It's no surprise that the next stop was the Charmed house itself. It turns out that one of the houses across the street and a couple next door were also used in the same series, and one of these houses was the center of Michael Jackson's "Thriller" music video. However, the street is full of beautiful Victorian houses, so it's not surprising that it's the center of various filming locations.

Next up was the famous viewpoint between two hills overlooking LA. Charmed was also filmed here when Prue considered jumping off the bridge. They filmed in many locations despite the show being set in San Francisco, right?

And finally, we took a walk through downtown. It was surprisingly empty due to the heat (and everything being closed with no tourists around). The footage we captured looked somewhat apocalyptic. We stopped by the Walt Disney Concert Hall and climbed the Angel's Flight staircase (hello, La La Land) before our sun tolerance ran out. And since our flight was approaching, we had to return the car and board the plane back to Seattle.
