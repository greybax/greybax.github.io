An extraordinary place - relaxation for the eyes and for the soul ... 
The target was of course Neuschwanstein Castle. It was never medieval - it was originally built with the aim of creating a magical castle. On the walls there are frescoes with different operas ("Tristan and Isolde" and others), very colorful decoration ... It's a pity that you can't take pictures inside - the caretakers are watching this.

There are many people in the meadows near the castle, but even here you can find a secluded place, climbing higher into the mountains.

But what really turns the action into a fairy tale is Alpzee. Tame swans on the shore, mountains approaching the lake, classical music, and a view of the castles. Whether you are there in summer or early fall, be sure to take a dip - very refreshing and inspiring!

F√ºssen himself is also pretty nice. Town houses are painted in pastel houses, the streets are clean and comfortable. It stands on the border with Austria, you can walk and cross this invisible line.
