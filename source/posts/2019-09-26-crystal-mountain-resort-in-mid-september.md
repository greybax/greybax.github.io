In mid-September, we managed to catch the last warm days, and the cable car on Mount Crystal, which is closed before winter. It's about a two-hour drive from Seattle to get there.

I even caught some fidelity - as if we had arrived at Krasnaya Polyana in Sochi. The same green mountains, a cable car with closed cabins, although there will be more in Polyana :) The cable car rises to a height of about 2100 m in 12 minutes, and from above there is already a breathtaking view of the Rainier volcano. There were a few clouds, later they covered almost the entire peak.

There are folding chairs at the top - you can sit and just admire among the birds and chipmunks rushing right under your feet. The Belaya River flows below. There are a lot of chipmunks here - after all, there is still a restaurant on the top where you can sit warm and see the mountain peaks on the other side of the top - from that side a couple of years ago lightning struck the slope, and some of the trees burned down, and they are still being restored...

We had 2 options down - go down on foot - it's 3 hours along a rocky path, or take a leisurely walk along the top and go down in the same way, on a gondola. We chose the second option and climbed a little on the nearest hill.
In winter, a spa resort is also open here. According to reviews, the slopes here are more interesting than in Snoqualmie - yes, we see it anyway, only it takes us 40 minutes to drive to Snoqualmie along a wide highway, and here it takes 2 hours along a single-lane mountain road.
In any case, we will return here again - at least to go down on foot from the mountain.

P.S. Chipmunks here are not afraid of people at all - obviously, they are already used to it, and even pose a little for a photo :)
