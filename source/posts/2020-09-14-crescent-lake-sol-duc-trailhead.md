Day 2. An hour from Port Angeles to Crescent Lake, where we wanted to stop, but the crowds of people stopped us. We moved on, where we planned, but still found a secluded spot on the shore, where we rested a little and wet our feet. The water was surprisingly not very cold - people even swam. The water in this lake is surprisingly clear! And all thanks to the lack of algae.

Next we headed to the trail with the Sol Duc waterfalls. It is also located in the Olympic National Park. From the lake, it is about 40 minutes to drive deep into the mountains, mainly along the river of the same name.

The trail is about 2.5 kilometers long. The path is quite wide, and there were constantly people - the entire parking lot was full. At the end of the popular part of the trail is a 15-meter-high waterfall, right in the canyon between two rocks. Depending on the amount of water, it can split into four streams. The bridge over it was made from a fallen tree. On the opposite bank you can go down to the water and wash yourself with fresh water.

You can go a little further - where almost no one walks, and the path is very narrow. Here the sensations are a little more exciting, you hope that there is no bear waiting behind the nearest tree :) After walking literally another 10 minutes, you can find a second waterfall, and another bridge from a fallen tree, although it is even narrower (for one person) and with wooden handrails only on one side. The waterfall itself is hidden a little further down the river, but you can take a look at it if you climb a hill.

Here we ate boiled eggs and moved back. These 2 routes are not the only ones. A network of trails leaves from the parking lot to the nearest lakes and further into the mountains.
