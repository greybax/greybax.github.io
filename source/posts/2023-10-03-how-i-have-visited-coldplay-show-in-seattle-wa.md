## Intro

Coldplay, the British rock band known for their emotive lyrics and anthemic sound, is set to deliver a spellbinding performance that will leave you breathless. From chart-topping hits like "Fix You" and "Viva La Vida" to their latest album's celestial tracks, you'll experience a musical journey like no other.

They visited Seattle with a Music of the Spheres Tour on 21 September 2023.
I've never been to their concerts before. So it was my first experience. And from my perspective, it was the best English language show which I've visited. I've enjoyed the visual show with bracelets. It was amazing along with their most popular songs

I've filmed almost all the concert. So feel free to enjoy it on our YouTube channel:
