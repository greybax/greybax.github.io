Skagit Valley, **(2 hours by car from Seattle)**

Somehow it happens that when you move somewhere, you come across things or places that are very similar to where you moved from. The same sights / bell ringing / construction under the windows, similar landscapes...

Just like the Netherlands, Washington has flower fields. True, not in 15 minutes, but in a couple of hours - just the scale is different. And so - here are the same fields of daffodils and hyacinths. Tulips, we still do not find stable. But it is interesting to compare - in the Netherlands there is not enough space, so the beds are wide, and the distance between them is minimal. Here - the beds are narrower, and the distance between them is even probably wider than the beds themselves :)

It is interesting that the owners of this farm are trying to make the place as similar to Holland as possible - they put up a mill, except that there are not enough dug canals! But this is not surprising - after the second world war, the founder of this garden - William Roozen left the Netherlands and his family with a 200-year-old tulip business, moved to Washington and founded his own tulip dynasty. Now it is the largest plantation in the world for growing tulips, daffodils and irises.
