## Intro

Hey there, fellow iOS App Devs! Recently, I've started my journey as an iOS Developer, and after creating my first app, I faced the issue of creating screenshots for the App Store. It's kind of tough to create them if you don't know the specific tool that best suits your needs. I've tried Canva, different websites specialized in it, and all these tools look too complex and monstrous for me. I just wanted a simple UI that does a simple job - create App Screenshots for the App Store. After a bunch of investigations, I found [AppScreen Studio](https://appscreen.studio/).

## AppScreen Studio
