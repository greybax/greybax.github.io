Dusseldorf **(half an hour by train from Cologne)**

The capital of the North Rhine-Westphalia region, although not the largest city. A bit of industrialism, a bit of modern buildings in the Media Harbor (it's a pity only the "aliens" were taken away from the building), a bit of the old city.

On the banks of the Rhine stands the Rheinturm - a television tower with a height of 240 meters with an observation deck at a height of 166 meters. In good weather, you can even see the cathedral in Cologne. Due to the shape of the "leg", looking down and seeing almost the entire base is a little scary. In the evening, the world's largest clock is visible - in the form of lamps, divided into 3 groups - hours, minutes and seconds.

There is a wide embankment along the river, everything is just as clean everywhere.

During our walk, we came across a parade - horses, bands, banners, each group of people in their own costume...

Of the oddities - quite realistic figures of people on advertising stands, and crowds of Croats (after all, on the evening of that day there was a final with France)
