Beverly Hills, 20 minutes from Santa Monica by car

## 90210 Beverly Hills

It is not very clear what happened to the parking, so I chose a point in the park nearby. As it turned out later, on a tree 50 meters 3 years ago, Orel and Reshka hid a bottle in the face of Ivleeva ü§™

Impressions from Rodeo Drive were strange - it seems that there are always crowds of people, very expensive shops, and it evokes images from the movie ‚ÄúPretty Woman‚Äù, but ... The streets are deserted, and only a lonely Bugatti stands, flaunts, and the driver chats with the policeman. And in front of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel (where Pretty Woman was filmed) there is a block resembling a European street. There, as in the whole quarter, there are a lot of Italian brands. Of course everything is closed, but at least the windows are not boarded up with plywood.

In the process of exploring the surroundings, we accidentally found a small alley with fountains. It is not clear whether it was possible to enter there, even though the gates were open. But when we saw people there, we also went in. Passed through towards a building with an interesting dome, which turned out to be City Hall.

It was already starting to get hot - about 22 degrees, but the sun is active, so we walked along the adjacent ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù area. The layout is quite interesting - not just square blocks, but waves of streets. The vast majority of houses look rich, and some just like castles. Many are surrounded by green hedges. Google maps show that almost everyone has a swimming pool - without it, in such weather, nowhere, and in the middle (where there are more plots) - tennis courts. Get crazy. Along the roads there are different trees - but on the same street - in the same style. For example, on one - medium and tall palm trees in turn, and on the other - sprawling ficuses.

It's time to move to the hotel, wash off the sea salt and sleep. The next day is a tour of the suburbs.

_Happy visiting Beverly Hills, CA!_ :v:
