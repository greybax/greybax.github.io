Cabo San Lucas, Mexico (2 flights of 3 hours from Seattle)

We planned our vacation unexpectedly - just a month in advance. We figured out the names only on the spot. It turns out that there are 2 cities: Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. Our hotel is in the first, and we flew into the second. There are 30 km between them and they are connected by Highway #1 (it runs along the entire Pacific coast of Mexican California and continues further into the States). And the agglomeration of these two cities is called Los Cabos (Los - many, Cabos - cape).

We stayed at Pueblo Bonito Rose (from the color of the hotel - pink), right next to its sister hotel - Blanka (the walls, accordingly, are white). Both are located on the first line of El Medano beach, with a view of the cliffs. The beach overlooks the bay of the Sea of ​​Cortez, where ocean liners usually sail and many people swim. Now it is “usually” different - no liners, although at lunchtime there are many boats scurrying around the bay and offering various water activities. Due to the restrictions, the hotels are filled to a maximum of 30-40%, but it feels like you don’t need more.

The beach is quite narrow - about 20 meters. Half of it is fenced off from the hotels for sun loungers, the other half is filled with vendors selling all sorts of things and a wave runs in, sometimes it can be quite strong. The water is warm - 28°-29° in October. When you enter the water and pass the surf, the depth begins almost immediately. A meter - and you can no longer reach the bottom. The place where you can still stand is expressed as a function of the wave and time. But you immediately enter, you can swim out a little and lie on your back, or swim to the buoys. Once, a small crab ran along one of these buoys, and I had to swim to another. And so, there was no other living creature in the water - no fish, and, fortunately, no jellyfish.

Usually, before leaving the water, I floundered in the deep surf, and when the waves calmed down, I went out. Then I waited until they tried to pull me back, and then I went further with the next wave. But during my last swim before leaving, only 1 wave was calm. The next one, which I wanted to go out with, turned out to be even stronger, and when I turned around to look at it, I realized that it was too strong - higher than me. In an instant, I realized that I would not have time to dive back under it, so I had to run headlong, hoping that the wave would not cover me with my head.

This beach is convenient for watching sunrises. I tried to get up and come at least half an hour in advance to see how the sky was colored at such moments, and at the same time to swim (we swam in the sea only 2 hours after sunrise and 2 hours before sunset). There were already people on the beach at such an early hour - but they were only watching and taking pictures. Some, as soon as the sun appeared from under the water, immediately left, and missed half. And almost no one swam! Apart from me, there were only a couple more people, and not every morning. I was not at all against this arrangement - when else can you lie on the water in silence, listening to the morning cries of sea lions?
