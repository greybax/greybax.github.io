## Vacation in Italy (part 5)

## Venice

Venice (130 km from Bologna, 1.5 hours by train)

The most unusual city. Well, where else can you get to the airport by boat?

A city without cars, buses, bicycles... just you and water. But there are gondolas and water "minibuses".

It is nice to get lost here in the narrow alleys and unexpectedly go to some pier or just to the water.
The Grand Canal, Rialto Bridge, Piazza San Marco are must-see sights, but it's no less pleasant to get away from all this hustle and bustle and stroll along the distant embankments, where locals walk in the park.

It is a pity that Venice is sinking. Traces of flooding are visible on the walls, the hands of the canals reach out to the buildings (figuratively and in the form of an installation).

A wonderful ending to your vacation is to spend the sunset sitting on the promenade, with your feet down to the water, watching the scurrying boats and the waves coming towards you, and sipping a little limoncella.
