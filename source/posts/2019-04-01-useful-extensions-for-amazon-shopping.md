Amazon is a giant retail company and all of us (or at least most) know about it. Every day **amazon.com** trading on billions of dollars. Most of us used to buy on Amazon almost all your stuff. And me too. Also I like chrome browser extensions and have made a selection of [my useful github extensions week ago](/posts/my-collection-of-useful-github-extensions/). So in this article I'm going to share some of Chrome browser extension which will make your Amazon online shopping easy.

## Fakespot

> Analyze Amazon reviews when shopping online!

User reviews give you an idea of the quality of a product before you buy. The main problem is that companies hire people to post good reviews for bad products on sites like Amazon. This extension helps you analyze reviews and lets you know which ones are baloney and which you can trust so you don't waste your money.
