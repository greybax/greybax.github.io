We heard about a beautiful fishing village on the way to Canada, and decided to go there. But first we stopped at a coffee shop in Mount Vernon (an hour's drive), where we stayed last time on March 1st - the day the Earth stopped. And everyone went into quarantine. And we were returning from Canada and stayed home for almost the entire spring.

Then we stopped at flower fields with chrysanthemums, sunflowers and other colorful flowers, some with bumblebees. When we arrived, there was almost no one in the parking lot or in the fields. By the way, admission is free - after all, everything was closed during tulip season, and we are skipping it for another year. When we were getting ready to go back, the parking lot was suddenly full, as if we had brought everyone to the farm.

You could drive to Fairhaven itself on the highway or on a narrow mountain road, and we chose the latter (another hour's drive). She brought us to a small observation deck overlooking Samish Bay and a scattering of islands: Samish, Orca Islands and even the town of Anacortes, where we were a year ago.

Finally, having arrived in Fairhaven, we left the car in the center - there was a whole street allocated for parking, where cars can park in 2 rows, and another 2 rows will remain for driving. In general, this is considered a village, founded in 1883 and now it is part of the city of Bellingham. From here you can take a ferry to the nearest islands and to Canadian Victoria.

In general, the town is small - there are only 3 interesting houses on 3 streets, but there is delicious (moderately sweet) ice cream, old houses, and a mini-park where they show movies on the wall of a house. We reached the embankment - it is made in the form of a pier running parallel to the shore, which was made for industrial purposes at the end of the 19th century, but was rebuilt in 2004.
