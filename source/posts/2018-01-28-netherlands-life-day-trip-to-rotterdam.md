## Rotterdam

Rotterdam (1h by bus from Amsterdam) left a lasting impression.

Due to the fact that during the Second World War it was almost completely destroyed, the city was rebuilt modern, with many skyscrapers and architectural delights.

The wind was pretty strong (after all, the Meuse River is relatively wide and the delta is close), but for the locals it seems to be a light breeze.

It's funny that you can take the neighboring The Hague by metro.
