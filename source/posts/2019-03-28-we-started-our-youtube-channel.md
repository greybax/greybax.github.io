Hi everyone who read this post right now and perhaps found this blog helpful for yourself. I'm so excited to announce that we started our YouTube channel about travels, outdoor activities and life as is. Actually we started this channel about 1 month ago and it has already 13 videos. Some of videos without backstage voice, only music. But for now most of videos we've decided to make in russian.  If channel will grows and people will ask about english version we will think about translation and creating video on english.

While we donâ€™t know if our content will be useful to anyone. We do this as an experiment and just for ourselves as a memory of the places where we were.

At this moment most of our video on channel about skiing. Welcome and just check it out.

Here one of our video timelapse:
