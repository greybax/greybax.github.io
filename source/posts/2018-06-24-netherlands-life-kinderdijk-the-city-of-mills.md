We got to Kinderdijk accidentally. We approached just in time for the departure of the steamer from Rotterdam - to sail for only half an hour (and another half hour and you can sail to the neighboring city - Dordrecht # nano-country).

Earlier in the Netherlands there were a lot of mills of various types - for pumping water, grinding cereals, sawmills... There is not much left - most of it burned out (when trying to stop the blades, a spark can be struck from the friction of wood against wood). They were replaced by modern windmills.

Kinderdijk is the largest cluster of old mills. They stand along the canals, and people still live in them and the mills are still working!

Rotterdam is even more beautiful in summer. Everything is buried in greenery, many different waterfowl swim in the canals, which are quite interesting to watch.
