On the one hand, there is a typical southern climate, palm trees, rocks. On the other hand, there are tall cacti, lots of fish near unusual rocks, pelicans and dry air. Yes, surprisingly dry air, despite the fact that the town is located right at the very end of a peninsula that goes quite far into the ocean.

The most famous landmark is the Arch. We wanted to take a boat tour there, preferably early in the morning, while it was not too hot. A little unexpectedly for ourselves, we found ourselves in the city before 9 am, and took a transparent boat to take a closer look at these rocks. We had to immediately smear ourselves with cream, because despite the canopy, the sun was starting to bake.

This Arch marks the place where the Pacific Ocean meets the Gulf of California (aka the Sea of ​​Cortez). But before that, we were shown a flock of pelicans that had already gotten used to the crowds of boats passing by, and schools of fish that were already tired of waiting for their usual portion of tortilla, which the guides lure them with. Among them were quite large and brightly colored fish, some resembled Nemo's fish. Corals were visible under the water at the distant rocks, and sea lions were sitting on the rocks. The main lion was sitting proudly on the outermost rock.

The Sea of ​​Cortez has another name - the Vermillion Sea (cinnabar-colored sea, Google says it's a brick-red color). It stretches along the entire peninsula, more than 1,100 km long, with a maximum width of only 240 km, and the greatest depth reaches 3,400 m! The sea is considered one of the most biologically diverse seas on the planet. The humpback whale, killer whale, giant Manta Ray, and the large Humboldt squid live here. And also - the largest animal on earth - the blue whale! Cabo is also famous for its days of hunting for Marlins (aka Sailfish) - the fastest swimming fish in the world (can reach speeds of up to 100 km / h)!
