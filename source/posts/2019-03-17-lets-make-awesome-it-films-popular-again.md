Actually I would write this post as soon as repo [awesome-it-films](https://github.com/greybax/awesome-IT-films) will reached **100 stars** on Github. But I missed this moment... 

Instead of it I woke up one day and as usually went to my github profile just for checking and do some my stuff there. And what could I see... Awesome-IT-Films repo just got **300 stars** for one day. 

And for now I still didn't realize how it happens. Just only one day before it was **59 stars**. Repo just increased 5x stars per night. I started to investigate some sources which my repo got users came from.

I would to appreciate this guy which is twitted my repo in their twitter with more 1k followers.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you&#39;re looking for IT movies to watch, you could check this out <a href="https://t.co/B7piGghDAx">https://t.co/B7piGghDAx</a><br><br>cc <a href="https://twitter.com/greybax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@greybax</a></p>&mdash; Ademola âš¡ (@_ooade) <a href="https://twitter.com/_ooade/status/1098906129780879360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It could be happens a big start to this explosive growth. 

For now at March 18 repo already reached more than **600 stars** on Github and this is most popular repo on my account at this moment. 
So now people came from some of topics like: [tv-series](https://github.com/topics/tv-series), [tv-shows](https://github.com/topics/tv-shows), [movie-collection](https://github.com/topics/movie-collection), [geeks](https://github.com/topics/geeks) on Github where this repo placed on the top of the list.

I would like to thank you everyone who starred it. 

So, what for now? I changed license to CC0 and waiting approval of [my PR on awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/pull/1434) by [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus). 

What I learned form it? Just keep doing what you love and love what you doing. Sooner or later your work will be appreciated. :v:
