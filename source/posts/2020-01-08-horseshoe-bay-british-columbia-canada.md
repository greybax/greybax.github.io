What a compact Vancouver! On the way to this bay, we stopped at Lighthouse Park (75 hectares) - it’s 20 minutes away, and that’s because after the route you only need to go down the serpentine. We went here "for good luck" and did not lose - we did not notice a little, walked and found a point from which you can see the downtown, although not close.

And right next to it is a lighthouse built more than a hundred years ago - in 1875, and in 1914 it was replaced from wood to stone. You can’t get too close, but you can detect the pattern of its flicker.

It takes 15 minutes to drive from the park to Horseshoe Bay along the picturesque serpentine along the coast. It's funny that from North Vancouver, along the highway - the same 15 minutes, because you don't have to go anywhere. Only 1,000 people live in this city on the shores of a charming bay! We went there for a bite to eat, and as we have seen everywhere in Canada, the food was very tasty!

There are very few cafes - only the embankment. And the embankment looks at the bay, on the one hand it turns out a ridge of mountains, and on the other, islands are scattered, which can be reached by ferry, which goes from the same embankment. The highway that comes from Vancouver ends at this pier, and its branch goes further north to the Republican resort of Whistler

We were there a little time, so we didn’t have time to ride the ferries (and you can even leave to go to Vancouver Island - yes, it’s hard with imagination - and then to Victoria, and on the ferry to Port Angeles, well, and further along the knurled to Seattle). But on the other hand, we managed to watch the sunset from White Cliff Park.

In this park, at the exit to a small bay, you can see an island, which you can walk to at low tide, but at that moment water separated it from the land. On the other side there was a small rock where I couldn't help climbing. From there, a wonderful view of the sunset and another bay opens up - the shores are very indented there, so there are many islands and different bays and bays. And although the descent down was a little more difficult than the ascent - due to the smooth stones, it was worth it!
